**Social Scientist** in love with **Data Science**, with a background in **Economics**. Over the last five years, I've been studying private pensions in Europe as part of a project at Carlos III de Madrid University. Under this project, I have co-authored two published papers with my PhD Advisor, Juan J. FernÃ¡ndez.
